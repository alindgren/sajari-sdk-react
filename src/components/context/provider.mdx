# Provider
`<Provider />` is the component that maintains the state of the search,
does the queries, and provides the response to the other components so
that they can update themselves when needed.

## Props

<PropsTable of={Provider} />

## Usage

```javascript
import { Provider, Pipeline, Values } from "@sajari/sdk-react";

const pipeline = new Pipeline(
  {
    project: "<your-project>",
    collection: "<your-collection>"
  },
  "website"
);

const values = new Values();


ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider search={{pipeline, values}}>
    {/* Your application code here */}
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
)
```
