# Sajari React SDK

`@sajari/sdk-react` is a client side javascript library of React Components for the
[Sajari](https://www.sajari.com) search platform to help build fast and powerful search interfaces.

React provides a simple and elegant way to structure user interfaces.
The Sajari React SDK provides a way to seamlessly integrate the Sajari platform
into any web-based app through the use of easily composable Components.

We also provide a vanilla Sajari JS library [here](https://github.com/sajari/sajari-sdk-js/).
