It has been created using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) tool to make development and deployment quick and easy.

## Requirements

**Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine to develop + build prod assets for this example**. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

# Getting Started

To use this as a starting point for your own search interface, copy this entire directory into your own workspace.

## Development

This example comes with great dev tooling (courtousy of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  To get up and running:

```shell
$ npm install   # Install dependencies
$ npm run start # Start development server
```

Now open [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) to see the example running in development mode.  Any changes you make to the code will be automatically synced to your browser.

## Build for production

To create a production-ready build of a completed application (with compressed assets etc):

```shell
$ npm build
```
